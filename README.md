Odin - Foundations Course - Project: Recipes

This is the first project built from scratch on Odin's Foundations Course.

It is actually incredible how quick it is when using Cursor to fill in blanks:
- Creates boilerplate HTML
- Autofills types and properties for images etc., text descriptions of dishes (GenAI!!) and other HTML elements
- It adapts rapidly when you copy paste code over from one recipe to another
